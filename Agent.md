## Agent in Azure AI Foundry

## What is an AI Agent?

Within Azure AI Foundry, an AI Agent acts as a "smart" microservice that can be used to answer questions (RAG), perform actions, or completely automate workflows. It achieves this by combining the power of generative AI models with tools that allow it to access and interact with real-world data sources
